# Business-Applications
My implementations and adaptations of the exercises in the free beginner Udemy Course: Practice Java by Building Projects. This is just a collection of code that I wanted to showcase for my blog at https://dataridder.nl. There is no actual application here that will work outside of the IDE, except perhaps the Email Appliction that I expanded with a Swing interface. Also some applications might be unfinished and neither of them is very impressive in any way.
